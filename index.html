            <p>
                I think studying abroad is the most important turning point in my life, which means that my life has entered another track since then. For me, coming to a completely unfamiliar country first meant that I needed to live an independent life without the company of my parents. Most of the time, there was no one to help me, and I had to learn to rely on myself and grow in loneliness. Second, it allowed me to embrace a different culture and see another possibility in life.

    <p style="width: 50%; padding: 40px 0;">I learned a new language and made friends with classmates from different countries, a life I had never imagined before. Third, it gave me the opportunity to learn more, broaden my horizons and prepare me to be a great person in the future.</p>

            <p>I'm saying so not because I don't like money or I think the value of an excellent job can surpass everything. Instead, I feel like it depends on my situation. If I'm a very poor person, money must be more important to me than a rich person. Then I think winning the lottery and having a lot of money will help me much more. But if I already have enough money to live a prosperous life, then a perfect job may reflect my life value more.</p>

        <p>If there is a chance to go back in time, the time I most want to go back to might be my childhood. As I grew up, I found that there were more and more things to worry about. If only I could go back to my childhood, which was a carefree time, and I had a lot of friends and a lot of time with my parents. When I came to another country, I realized how little time I spent with my parents. Now, I wish I had more time to spend with them. </p>

            <h2>WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN FIVE YEARS?</h2>
            <p>At one time, I thought that life could develop in the direction that we worked hard at; but in reality, many surprises will disrupt our plans. For example, black swan events like the COVID-19 pandemic have caught many people off guard. I have academic plans and career dreams. But right now, it's hard for me to know exactly where I'll be in five years. However, it is foreseeable that I will do my best to improve myself to become a better me. </p>
